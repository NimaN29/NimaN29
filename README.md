Hello, I’m Marie!

I recently developed an attraction to programming and am keen to gain more experience. 

On my GitHub, I would like to share with you some of my completed assignments and projects, which helped me to obtain my certifications.

As of now, I have only one I would like to share with you. But more is to come.

I hope you like what you see and thank you for stopping by.
